//The aim of this project is to take reading of the button which is connected to the 5 v when the button is pressed the reading is atken to be HIGH the problem is when the Button
//isn't pressed the input pin value is floating so we add a Very high resistor 10 Kohm to pull the input pin to Ground when the key isn't pressed 

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

//  Serial.begin(9600);
//
//  //Configure Digital Pins
//  pinMode(8, INPUT); //The Ardunio outputs the value on it

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
//  Serial.println(digitalRead(8));

}
