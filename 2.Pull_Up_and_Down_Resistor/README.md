# Pull-up and Pull-down resistance
This project aims to explain the idea of pull-up and pull-down resistors.

### Pull Down:
When the button is connected to the 5v when the button is pressed the reading is taken to be HIGH the problem is when the Button
isn't pressed the input pin value is floating so we add a Very high resistor 10 Kohm to pull the input pin to the Ground when the key isn't pressed take the reading of the button which is 
connected to the 5 v when the button is pressed the reading is taken to be HIGH.


### Pull Up:
When the button is connected to the 0v when the button is pressed the reading is taken to be LOW the problem is when the Button
isn't pressed the input pin value is floating so we add a Very high resistor 10 Kohm to pull the input pin to 5v when the key isn't pressed take the reading of the button which is 
connected to the 0v when the button is pressed the reading is taken to be LOW.
